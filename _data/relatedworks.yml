  abstract: "Under frequency fitness assignment (FFA), the fitness corresponding to an objective value is its encounter frequency in fitness assignment steps and is subject to minimization. FFA renders optimization processes invariant under bijective transformations of the objective function value. On TwoMax, Jump, and Trap functions of dimension s, the classical (1+1)-EA with standard mutation at rate 1/s can have expected runtimes exponential in s. In our experiments, a (1+1)-FEA, the same algorithm but using FFA, exhibits mean runtimes that seem to scale as sÂ² ln s. Since Jump and Trap are bijective transformations of OneMax, it behaves identical on all three. On OneMax, LeadingOnes, and Plateau problems, it seems to be slower than the (1+1)-EA by a factor linear in s. The (1+1)-FEA performs much better than the (1+1)-EA on W-Model and MaxSat instances. We further verify the bijection invariance by applying the Md5 checksum computation as transformation to some of the above problems and yield the same behaviors. Finally, we show that FFA can improve the performance of a memetic algorithm for job shop scheduling."

  abstract: "The performance of evolutionary algorithms can be heavily undermined when constraints limit the feasible areas of the search space. For instance, while covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most efficient algorithms for unconstrained optimization problems, it cannot be readily applied to constrained ones. Here, we used concepts from memetic computing, i.e., the harmonious combination of multiple units of algorithmic information, and viability evolution, an alternative abstraction of artificial evolution, to devise a novel approach for solving optimization problems with inequality constraints. Viability evolution emphasizes the elimination of solutions that do not satisfy viability criteria, which are defined as boundaries on objectives and constraints. These boundaries are adapted during the search to drive a population of local search units, based on CMA-ES, toward feasible regions. These units can be recombined by means of differential evolution operators. Of crucial importance for the performance of our method, an adaptive scheduler toggles between exploitation and exploration by selecting to advance one of the local search units and/or recombine them. The proposed algorithm can outperform several state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of benchmark and engineering problems, both for quality of solutions and computational resources needed."

  abstract: "While reinforcement learning algorithms can learn effective policies for complex tasks, these policies are often brittle to even minor task variations, especially when variations are not explicitly provided during training. One natural approach to this problem is to train agents with manually specified variation in the training task or environment. However, this may be infeasible in practical situations, either because making perturbations is not possible, or because it is unclear how to choose suitable perturbation strategies without sacrificing performance. The key insight of this work is that learning diverse behaviors for accomplishing a task can directly lead to behavior that generalizes to varying environments, without needing to perform explicit perturbations during training. By identifying multiple solutions for the task in a single environment during training, our approach can generalize to new situations by abandoning solutions that are no longer effective and adopting those that are. We theoretically characterize a robustness set of environments that arises from our algorithm and empirically find that our diversity-driven approach can extrapolate to various changes in the environment and task."

  abstract: "Multiobjective optimization in general aims at learning aboutthe problem at hand.  Usually the focus lies on objectivespace properties such as the front shape and the distributionof optimal solutions. However, structural characteristics inthe decision space can also provide valuable insights. In cer-tain applications, it may even be more important to find astructurally diverse set of close-to-optimal solutions than toidentify a set of optimal but structurally similar solutions.Accordingly, multiobjective optimizers are required that arecapable of considering both the objective space quality ofa Pareto-set approximation and its diversity in the decisionspace.Although NSGA, one of the first multiobjective evolution-ary algorithms, explicitly considered decision space diversity,only a few other studies address that issue. It therefore isan open research question how modern multiobjective evolu-tionary algorithms can be adapted to search for structurallydiverse high-quality Pareto-set approximations. To this endwe propose an approach to integrate decision space diversityinto hypervolume-based multiobjective search. We presenta modified hypervolume indicator and integrate it into anevolutionary algorithm. The proof-of-principle results showthe potential of the approach and indicate further researchdirections for structure-oriented multiobjective search."

  abstract: "Typically, optimization attempts to find a solution which minimizes the given objective function. But often, it might also be useful to obtain a set of structurally very diverse solutions which all have acceptable objective values. With such a set, a decision maker would be given a choice of solutions to select from. In addition, he can learn about the optimization problem at hand by inspecting the diverse close-to-optimal solutions.This paper proposesNOAH, an evolutionary algorithm which solves a mixed multi-objective problem: Determine a maximally diverse set of solutions whose objective values are below a provided objective barrier. It does so by iteratively switching between objective value and set-diversity optimization while automatically adapting a constraint on the objective value until it reaches the barrier. Tests on an nk-Landscapes problem and a 3-Sat problem as well as on a more realistic bridge construction problem show that the algorithm is able to produce high quality solutions with a significantly higher structural diversity than standard evolutionary algorithms."

  abstract: "We present an optimization framework for generating diverse variations of physics-based character motions. This allows for the auto- matic synthesis of rich variations in style for simulated jumps, flips, and walks. While well-posed motion optimization problems result in a single optimal motion, we explore using underconstrained motion descriptions and then optimizing for diversity. As input, the method takes a parameterized controller for a successful motion instance, a set of constraints that should be preserved, and a pairwise distance metric between motions. An offline optimization then produces a highly diverse set of motion styles for the same task. We demonstrate results for a variety of 2D and 3D physics-based motions and show that this approach can generate compelling new motions."
